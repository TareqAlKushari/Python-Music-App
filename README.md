# Python Music App

A simple and interactive music player application built with Python. This project allows users to play, manage, and enjoy their favorite music tracks through a user-friendly interface.

## Overview

The **Python Music App** is designed for music lovers who want a lightweight, customizable, and easy-to-use music player. Built using Python and popular libraries for audio playback and GUI development, the app serves as a great example for those learning about multimedia programming, GUI design, and event-driven application development in Python.

## Features

- Play, pause, stop, and skip music tracks
- Support for popular audio formats (e.g., MP3, WAV)
- Playlist management (add, remove, reorder songs)
- Basic UI for song selection and playback controls
- Volume and playback progress control
- Modular codebase for easy expansion
